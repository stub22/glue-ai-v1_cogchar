CogChar is an open source cognitive character technology platform.
<br/>Our characters may be physical (robots), virtual, or both.
<br/>Applications include therapeutics, education, research, and fun!
</p>
<p>The CogChar project is Java based, but network integratable, connecting several other open source projects.
<br/>Coghcar provides an important ingredient of the <a href="http://glue.ai">Glue.AI</a> software recipe.
</p>
<p>CogChar provides a set of connected subsystems for experimental, iterative character creation.
<br/>We aim to engineer a highly integrated yet modular system that allows many intelligent humanoid character features to be combined as freely and yet robustly as possible.
<br/>We achieve robust modularity using the OSGi standard for Java applications, although our individual features can often be run outside of OSGi.  
<br/>Our outlook for Android compatibility is very bright, although we can't control or predict what Oracle and Google will do in coming years.
<br/>We directly support networking over HTTP and AMQP.
</p>
<p>Cogchar by itself is primarily a set of bundles used to assemble your character application.
<br/>We do have some runnable demonstrations included in our bundles.  
<br/>Here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ArBjkBoH40tndGFZeVlzd1VYUm1mYWRPRU01VllrNXc&gid=1">spreadsheet summary</a> of our user interface components and Glue.AI containers.
</p>

<h4>External Features</h4>
Many of our subsystems come to us thru another open source software project (many of which are part of the Glue.AI effort).  Specifically, Cogchar has the following main external ingredients:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Humanoid robotics capabilities of <a href="http://www.mechio.org">MechIO</a> open source robotic device layer, including APIs for servos, sensors, animation, vision, and speech.</li>
<li>RDF/SPARQL/OWL semantic software stack of the <a href="http://www.appdapter.org">Appdapter</a> project (which itself is primarily dependent on 
<a href="http://jena.apache.org">Jena</a>)</li>
<li>3D character rendering to OpenGL using <a href="http://jmonkeyengine.com">JMonkey Game Engine</a>, LWJGL, BulletPhysics</li>
<li>Web interaction using the <a href="http://liftweb.net/">Lift</a> framework (combine or replace with your own bundled webapp using PAX-WEB launcher).</li>
</ul>
<p>After reading this list, it's perhaps rather obvious that one of the main goals of the Cogchar project is to achieve a useful simulation duality between real robotics worlds in the MechIO space, and various onscreen 3D OpenGL worlds.  We seek to do that as flexibly as possible, with the definition of world mappings occuring in the semantic space, with minimal need for software extensions.

<h4>Internal Feature Goals</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Flexible <b>behavior</b> authoring, editing, sharing, and triggering.</li>
	<li>Variable, authorable, testable <b>mappings</b> between various character and world coordinate systems, as well as between symbolic spaces.</li>
	<li><b>Fusion of sensor and symbol streams</b>, applied to self-image and model of world.</li>
	<ul><li>Character sees, hears, touches and knows in many related symbolic and physical/virtual/numeric dimensions.</li>
		<li>My left-eye camera sees some pixels, some of which are recognized as a face, which may be matched to a name, which I may choose to say, producing a certain sound...</li>
		<li>I am standing on a floor, so my feet feel pressure from the floor.  I am holding my torso erect above my legs, and my head above my torso.  I am looking at a person called Samantha.  I can describe these facts to you in spoken words, and you can also see these facts reflected in my physical/virtual display, because they are coming from the same world-image, built from the current fused estimate of all available information (both physical and symbolic).</li>

	</ul>
	
	<li><b>Blended adaptive estimators and controllers</b></li>
		<ul><li>Run a wide variety numeric and symbolic learning algorithms(bayesian, HMM, neural, genetic, you name it),
				using Java, Scala, R, Weka, Hadoop, DL-Learner.</li>
			<li>Metadata-driven analysis and update of 1) immutable trajectory logs (pruned) and 2) mutable state vectors (markovian).</li>
		</ul>
	<li><b>Reasoning and rendering of body and mind</b></li>
	<ul><li>Interact with visualizations of character's body, mind, and environment, overlapped in interesting ways (what's inside the character's left ear right now?)</li>
		<li>Standard OpenGL 3D display for any compatible device (computer, tablet, smartphone, game console)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<li><b>Ongoing conversation coordination</b></li>
		<ul><li>Keep track of many conversation partners over any length of time (minutes to years).</li>
			<li>Consult reference sources during conversations, and decide which ones to mention (feature provided by Cogbot).</li>
			<li>Conversation is integrated with embodiment, self-image, and world model.</li>
		</ul>
</ul>
