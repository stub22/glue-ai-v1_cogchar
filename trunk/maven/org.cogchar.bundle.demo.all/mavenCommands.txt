#If in cygwin you will do something like:

cd /cygdrive/p/_prj/s2/cogchar/cogchar_trunk/maven/org.cogchar.bundle.demo.all

#From Windows prompt, it will be more like:

cd \your\awesome\windows\path

#From there, assuming your JAVA_HOME, M2_HOME, ANT_HOME, and PATH are set up well, you can do:

mvn clean
mvn package
mvn -Prun-on-felix antrun:run

# After success on those, you can then use ant directly to run with a standard felix console,
#  using either    run.sh,  run.bat, or, even more directly:

ant -f ant_run.xml -propertyfile target/felix.ant.run.props

# Our Maven pom file is based on the following, with additions in support of our little  
# properties writing scheme.

#org.scala-tools.archetypes
#scala-archetype-simple
