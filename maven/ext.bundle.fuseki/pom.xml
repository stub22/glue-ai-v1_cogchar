    <name>${artifactId} - OSGi Bundle for Jena Fuseki servlet</name>
<!-- This project is intended to replace o.c.b.bind.joseki, which
served 3 purposes:

    1) OSGi bundling for runtime discovery by PAX-Web.
        (See web deployment instructions in the pom.xml of o.c.b.bind.joseki)
    
    2) Easy attachment of the PUMA "main" repo, the existence of which is a 
    simplistic assumption that we are outgrowing.  (Previously accomplished
    by java hack, possibly replacable with Assembler plugins accessing 
    a registry to attach our repos as specified in Fueski config.ttl).
    
    3) Aynch notification from the Servlet of each Update processed to a
    listener registered by a PUMA application.  (Ugly java hack, used by
    our Goody V-World service to hear commands from java-HTTP-client, via
    temporary naive ThingActionRouter/Consumer pattern).
    
    These features place the bundle more in the "bind" category than the "ext"
    category.  So, if we wind up replicating these features, we probably
    need a bundle called o.c.bundle.bind.fuseki.   However, for the moment
    we are experimenting with a more pure/thin wrapper around the jena-fuseki
    jar, which so far it is appropriate to call ext.bundle.fuseki_0_2_7.

            <!-- "jena-fuseki" transitively pulls in its own copies of the Jena libraries.
                If we decide to copy+modify the source of Fuseki, as we did in 
                o.c.bundle.bind.joseki, then we would not have this dependency,
                and we would just use Appdapter's ext.bundle.jena_all_2_10_1.
                
                But if we manage to *not* copy+modify Fuseki's source, then
                we will probably want to "exclude" the Jena dependencies
                brought in by jena-fuseki, as well as the Jetty stuff it
                pulls in (which we get via PAXWeb, instead), although we
                note that the existing o.c.bundle.bind.joseki is sloppy
                about these issues, and it hasn't caused any known problems.
