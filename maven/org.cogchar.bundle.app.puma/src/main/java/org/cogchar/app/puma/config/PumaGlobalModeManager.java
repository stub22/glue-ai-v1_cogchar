	// and everything else uses myGlobalConfig in this class. (Lifter auto-updates when the GlobalConfigService restarts.)
	// But really this is a can of worms, so probably we should move to having both the
	// GlobalConfigService and myGlobalConfig always be updated at the same time. Not yet though, until the possible implications are worked through...

	// service. This is best seen as a trial of one possible way to handle the "GlobalMode" graph configuration.
	// What we'll do here is tell the PumaAppContext to make the GlobalConfigEmitter available as a no-lifecycle
	// managed service. (Why no-lifecycle? Because these lifecycles have to end somewhere! But it would make sense
	// to make this service depend on the query interface if we decide to keep it.)
	// Then Lifter can access it to load its config.
	// The problem with this approach is that it elevates the GlobalConfigEmitter to a data structure of particular 
	// importance outside of PUMA (we're putting it on the OSGi registry for crying out loud!), when at this early
	// point I've been trying to keep non-PUMA code "agnostic" to any details of the graph "mode" config other than
	// the Idents of the graph.
	// So this may be a bad-idea-dead-end. Unless we decide we've fallen in love with both the GlobalConfigEmitter
	// and the idea of doing config via managed services, in which it may turn out to be just what we need.
	// For now, we'll restrict usage of this to the LifterLifeCycle only...
